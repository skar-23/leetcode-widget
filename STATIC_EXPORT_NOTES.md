# Static Export Configuration

This Next.js application is configured for static export (`output: 'export'` in `next.config.ts`) to enable deployment as static files to any hosting platform.

## What was changed to support static export:

1. **Server Actions disabled**: The `getMotivationalMessageAction` in `src/app/actions.ts` is no longer used because Server Actions are incompatible with static exports.

2. **MotivationCard updated**: The component now generates motivational messages using client-side logic instead of AI-powered server actions.

3. **Fetch caching**: Removed `cache: 'no-store'` from the LeetCode API fetch to allow static generation.

## To re-enable AI functionality:

1. Remove `output: 'export'` from `next.config.ts`
2. Update `MotivationCard` component to use `getMotivationalMessageAction` again
3. Ensure you have proper environment variables for Google AI API

## Benefits of static export:

- Can be deployed to any static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, S3, etc.)
- No server required
- Better performance and caching
- Lower hosting costs

## Trade-offs:

- No Server Actions (AI-powered motivational messages disabled)
- API calls happen at build time for static generation
- Less dynamic functionality
